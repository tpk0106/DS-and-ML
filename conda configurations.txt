Customizing an environment during Anaconda installation is not a direct option within the installer itself. The Anaconda installer primarily sets up the base Anaconda environment and the Anaconda Navigator. Custom environments are created after the initial installation.
There are two primary ways to create and customize environments in Anaconda:
1. Using Anaconda Navigator (Graphical User Interface):

    Open Anaconda Navigator: Launch the Anaconda Navigator application.

Navigate to Environments: In the left-hand pane, click on "Environments."
Create New Environment: Click the "Create" button at the bottom of the environments list. 
Configure Environment:

    Provide a descriptive name for your new environment.

Select the desired Python or R version for this environment.
(Optional) Choose specific packages to include during creation, though most packages are typically installed after environment creation.

Click Create: Anaconda will then create the new, customized environment.

2. Using the Conda Command Line (Anaconda Prompt/Terminal):

    Open Anaconda Prompt or Terminal: Launch the Anaconda Prompt (Windows) or a terminal with Conda initialized (macOS/Linux).
    Create Environment: Use the conda create command to create a new environment.

Code

    conda create --name my_custom_env python=3.9 numpy pandas

    Replace my_custom_env with your desired environment name.

Specify a Python version (e.g., python=3.9) and any initial packages (e.g., numpy pandas).
Activate Environment: After creation, activate the environment to work within it.

Code

    conda activate my_custom_env

    Install Additional Packages: Install any other necessary packages using conda install.

Code

    conda install matplotlib scikit-learn

Key Considerations for Customization:

    Environment Isolation:
    Each environment is isolated, meaning packages installed in one environment do not affect others. This prevents dependency conflicts between different projects.
    Python/R Version:
    Choose the specific Python or R version required for your project.
    Package Management:
    Install only the necessary packages to keep your environments clean and efficient.
    Environment Variables:
    For advanced customization, you can define environment-specific variables within the environment's activation/deactivation process.


load jupyter notebook 

1 load the terminal (python shell)

to check all dev (if not sure)

list all envs

(C:\Data Science and ML\env) PS C:\Data Science and ML> conda env list

# conda environments:
#
                     * C:\Data Science and ML\env
                       C:\Users\thusi\Documents\env
base                   C:\Users\thusi\anaconda3

2 activate dev folder

(base) : conda activate C:\Data Science and ML\env

(C:\Data Science and ML\env) PS C:\Data Science and ML> jupyter notebook

3 type jupyter notebook and load it. 
(C:\Data Science and ML\env) PS C:\> jupyter notebook
